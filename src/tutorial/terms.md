## Terms

Terms inhabit Types.
Terms are also called Values.
A Value has a finite representation.
When run as a program, these values will be represented as 1s and 0s.

```lsts
True: Boolean;

1: Integer;

1.2: Real;

1.2+3i: Complex;

'a': Character;

"bc": String;

(1,True): (Odd, Boolean);

[7, 11]: Prime[];

{2, 6, 10}: Set<Even>;

{1=2, 3=4, 5=6, 7=8}: Map<Integer,Integer>;
```
