## Axiom Statements

Axioms don't need to be proven by deduction.
The assumption that an axiom is valid is the only difference between an axiom and a theorem.
Theorems and Axioms share the same syntax aside from the initial keyword: forall vs axiom.

### Deduction

Axioms can immediately be used to justify Theorems after definition.

### Preludes

Choosing axioms is one of the most important parts of defining a prelude.
Not all axioms are appropriate for all preludes.
For this reason some preludes are incompatible with each other.
