# Introduction

**lsts** is a proof assistant and sometimes a programming language.
LSTS is designed for assisted reasoning in mathematical proofs.
For those feeling particularly adventurous, it may even be possible to use as a programming language.

* Lightweight. [LSTS] is only 3K sloc of Rust code with no dependencies.
* Fast. [Benchmarks] compare to Rust itself for compilation speed and efficiency.
* Familiar. The [Syntax] is usually similar to Coq, ML, or Haskell.
