# The Philosophy of YES

Despite our desire to be all things to all people, sometimes consequential design decisions are unavoidable.
LSTS is meant to be a platform that others can leverage to build cool things.
To this end we have committed to a policy of *configuration over code*.
Configuration over code means that whenever possible we will make our design decisions configurable opt-in choices.
LSTS is not meant to be an opinionated software.
We want to empower our users to build cool things using any methodology that seems appropriate.
