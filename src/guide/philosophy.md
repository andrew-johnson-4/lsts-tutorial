# The Philosophy of YES

Despite our desire to be all things to all people, sometimes consequential design decisions are unavoidable.
LSTS is meant to be a platform that others can leverage to build cool things.
To this end we have committed to a policy of *configuration over code*.
Configuration over code means that whenever possible we will make our design decisions configurable opt-in choices.
LSTS is not meant to be an opinionated software.
We want to empower our users to build cool things using any methodology that seems appropriate.

Acknowledging the obvious commitments like syntax and semantics. We realize that
few concepts will map one-to-one with our project structure. However we will go
out of our way to ensure that there *exists* a mapping from your idea to our
platform.

Do you want different syntax? We will help you build it leveraging our codebase.

Do you want slightly different inference rules? We will help you build a plugin.

Your project. Our logic. Your success. Our success.
